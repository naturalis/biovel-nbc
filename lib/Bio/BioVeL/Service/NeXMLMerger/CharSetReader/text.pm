=item read_charsets

Reads character set definitions from a text file. The syntax is expected to be like what
is used inside C<mrbayes> blocks and inside C<sets> blocks after the charset token, 
i.e.:

	<name> = <start coordinate>(-<end coordinate>)?(\<phase>)? ...;

That is, the definition starts with a name and an equals sign. Then, one or more 
coordinate sets. Each coordinate set has a start coordinate, an optional end
coordinate (otherwise it's interpreted as a single site), and an optional phase statement,
e.g. for codon positions. Alternatively, instead of coordinates, names of other character 
sets may be used. The statement ends with a semicolon. 

Each line with data in it is dispatched to C<read_charset> for reading. After reading, the 
collection of character sets is then dispatched to
L<Bio::BioVeL::Service::NeXMLMerger::CharSetReader::text::resolve_references> to 
resolve any named character sets that were referenced in lieu of coordinate sets. The
coordinate sets of the referenced character sets are deepcloned to replace the reference.

=item resolve_references

Given a collection of character sets, finds the coordinate sets that are named references
to other characters sets, looks them up and copies over their coordinates.

=item read_charset

Reads a character set, returns:

1. a character set name

2. an array reference of coordinate sets. Each set is represented as a hash reference as
follows:

	{
		'start' => <start coordinate>, # required
		'end'   => <end coordinate>,   # optional
		'phase' => <steps to the next site in set>, # optional
		'ref'   => <name of character set>, # optional
	}
